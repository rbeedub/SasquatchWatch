# SasquatchWatch

 Some people believe in Sasquatch because they find the idea of a mysterious, unknown creature living in the wilderness to be exciting or romantic. Still others may believe in Sasquatch as a way to explain strange noises or other unexplained phenomena that they have experienced in the woods. Ultimately, belief in Sasquatch is a matter of personal belief, and there is no scientific evidence to support its existence. Until now.
